## Project-1-Html
 I have created a website with the help of HTML5 and CSS3 that comprises of my biodata (infomation), my interests on the first page. Second page contains my information on the resume (job experience, achievements) that is easily accessible. Third page consists complete information aobut my education. Fourth page contains my personal interests. There is a consist green-grey-white theme applied to all the pages of the website, where there is a resume option at the  bottom of very single page.  This website consists of four different pages such as First-Page Project, Resume Page, Educational Page and Personal Interest Page,  Apart from these pages there is another page that links all the other websites visible to a single landing page.
