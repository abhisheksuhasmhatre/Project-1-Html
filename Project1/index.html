		The main aim of this website is to get a platform in the designing field; to learn different things about html, css and javascript.
		My aim is to learn more about this language and get better at it. I want to work in this field in the mere future, hence this website.
		My end goal is to get good grades in this and in coming subjects, get a good UI-UX designer job.
		My audiences will be my professor who will be viewing it and grading it. Some potential employers looking for designers in a particular field.
		My friends or people online who are willing to take some notes from my site will be viewing it.

	<div>A win is not a victory, a lose is not a defeat,</div>
		<div>It is a game of time,</div>
		<div>And change is the necessity of nature</div>
		<div>-Shri Krishna (Mahabharat)</div>
		<p></p>
		<div>Everything in life is best endured in silence.</div>
		<div>-Karna (Mrityunjay)</div>

		<div>A man who endures insult for any reason succeeds in laying the groundwork of his own living death.</div>
		<div>-Karna (Mrityunjay)</div>
		<p></p>
		<div>Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned.</div>
		<div>-Gautam Buddha</div>
		<p></p>
		<div>Life and death, what a cruel game, is man born only to take part in this game. Whats does he live for? Why does he die? Death. What a great mystery it is.</div>
