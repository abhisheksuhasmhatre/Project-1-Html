		<div class = "italic">M.S. Electrical and Human Computer Interface Engineering expected December 2016.</div>
		<div class = "innerspacing">1 Lomb Memorial Dr, Rochester, NY, U.S.A. 14623</div>
		
		<div class = "innerspacing">I started my Masters Degree program this Fall 2014. I am pursuing my majors in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and specialization in Robotics.
		I transferred to HCI this fall, it is a designing oriented department where prototypes are made.</div>
		
		<div class = "innerspacing">Courses: Principles of Robotics, Modern Optics for Engineers, Research Methods, Foundations of Human Computer Interaction, 
		Information and Interaction Design, research methods, Foundations of Web Technologies, Prototyping Wearable and Internet of Things Devices,
		Independent Study for my Thesis.</div>
		
		<div class = "innerspacing">Projects: QuadCoptter - I did a project in Principles of Robotics, making a Quad-Copter. 
		It is controlled by the Arduino Pilot and a Arduino Board, which will be controlled by 6 channel controller.
		It has 2 ultrasonic sensors which detect obstacles in its path and the the sensors are be programmed with a
		preset value in distance (cm or meters) as the obstacle is reaches the preset value the Quad Copter will change direction as per the program.</div>
		
		<div class = "innerspacing">SlackApp: Built a prototype app, combination of pomodoro app and classroom app. 
		It can set study time and break time and give updates about upcoming deadlines, reminders, events can be managed. 
		InVision software was used to connect all the designs made in Adobe CC.

		<div class = "innerspacing">Projects: Mobile Bug - : It detects active call or message transmission in secured environment for a maximum range of 5 meters. 
		If there is a presence of an active mobile transmission then buzzer beeps.</div>
		
		<div class = "innerspacing">Encoder - I made a encoder which will show the digits on the blinking LEDs in a incrementing order. 
		3 bit binary input is given to the Integrated circuit and the output will be in encoded form.</div>
		
		<div class = "innerspacing">ToolBooth - This project isa toll booth system. It had a RFID tag will be placed at the toll booth and the money will deducted from the account, 
		it can categorize the vehicles in 2 wheeler and 4 wheeler. Whether there is money in the tag or needed to be recharged. 
		A project on cell phone detection and alarm device or a mobile bug.</div>
		
		<div class = "innerspacing">AAGMAN-An Automated Gadget for Military Based Applications - Final year bachelors degree project AAGMAN An Automated Gadget for Military Based Applications 
		is a military which was basically a tank which was over 12-15 kilograms. 
		It has a timer belt which is damage proof since it has copper wiring in the belt and the tank had individual suspensions. 
		It has a robotic arm on the tank which would pick and place objects from one place to other. 
		The motors used on the arm are 100rpm dc motors. 
		The motors used for the wheels are 500 rpm brushless dc motors which are operated at 24 volts external power source.</div></li>
